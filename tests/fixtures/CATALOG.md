# Test Fixture Catalog

Only synthetic or irreversibly anonymized documents may be committed. Fixtures
must not contain real candidate PII, credentials, or confidential job data.

| Fixture                      | Provenance                                                                                                                               | Expected use                                                                                                                                         | PII classification |

Add each new fixture here with its origin, expected parser/scoring outcome, and
PII classification before using it in automated tests.

`ocr-print-pilot.ts`: 18 original fictional English/India software-engineering
documents from six authored content/layout families, plus six retained diagnostic
controls. Existing unmodified Liberation Sans (SIL OFL 1.1, pinned SHA-256) is
rasterized by pinned Canvas 0.1.77; no downloaded font or host-font selection.
Clean 300-DPI, actual 150-DPI skew/blur/JPEG and native-middle mixed variants share
their family partition: 15 development / 3 calibration / 6 locked documents.
Labels and ordered line/code-point truth precede rasterization and recognition;
byte hashes are locked before each run and are explicitly platform-bound.
AI-only engineering annotation; human/representative validation not evaluated.
PII: none. Same font/renderer across families remains a generalization limitation.
