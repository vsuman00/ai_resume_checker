# Resumide Target Architecture

Status: **CANDIDATE B2C FOUNDATION APPROVED; ACCURACY-V2 ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTION APPROVED; AA010 AUTHORIZED; GATE A4 OPEN**
Last updated: 2026-10-03
Canonical execution documents: [`tasks/plan.md`](tasks/plan.md) and [`tasks/todo.md`](tasks/todo.md)
Accuracy-v2 sources: [`docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_SPEC.md`](docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_SPEC.md), [`docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_RESEARCH.md`](docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_RESEARCH.md), [`tasks/accuracy-authoring-plan.md`](tasks/accuracy-authoring-plan.md), and [`CONSTRAINTS.md`](CONSTRAINTS.md)

This document defines the target architecture for turning the current ResumeATS prototype into a reliable B2C product and, only after explicit gates are passed, an enterprise-capable platform. It is written for humans and implementation agents. Existing code is evidence of the current state, not proof that a capability is complete.

## 1. Product definition

Resumide helps a candidate understand how reliably their resume can be parsed, how closely it matches a job description, and how to improve it without inventing experience. Its core differentiators are:

1. A transparent evidence view showing what fields, lines, pages, and requirements were extracted, with method, location, confidence, and correction state.
2. Separate versioned, deterministic `ATS Compatibility` and `Job Alignment` results, gated by `Evidence Confidence`.
3. A job-description requirement view that distinguishes required, preferred, satisfied, partial, confirmation-required, missing, and not-evaluated evidence.
4. Qualitative writing feedback and drafts produced by an LLM under a strict schema and candidate-verified fact boundary; the model does not own numeric scoring.
5. A same-page improvement workspace that preserves immutable versions, accept/reject/undo history, and projected versus actual score deltas.
6. PDF/DOCX and later LaTeX generation from a canonical resume document, with parse-back verification before an artifact is labelled verified.

The product is **not** an exact emulator of Workday, Greenhouse, Oracle, Taleo, Lever, iCIMS, or another proprietary ATS. User-facing language must say “ATS compatibility guidance,” “job alignment,” or “parse simulation,” never claim guaranteed passage through an employer’s ATS. A vendor-specific claim requires controlled evidence for the named vendor and version. An interview/hiring probability requires a separately approved outcome-calibration study.

### Product modes

| Mode                    | Primary user             | Permitted purpose                            | Gate                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Candidate coach         | Individual job seeker    | Self-improvement and application preparation | Build first                    |
| Career-center workspace | Advisor and candidate    | Human-assisted coaching                      | After B2C reliability gate     |
| Employer workspace      | Recruiter or hiring team | Advisory review with human oversight         | Separate enterprise/legal gate |

Employer ranking, automatic rejection, or fully automated hiring decisions are out of scope until accuracy, fairness, human-oversight, and legal requirements are independently approved.

## 2. Status vocabulary

Every plan, task, PR, and handoff must use these labels:

- `IMPLEMENTED`: code exists in the current branch.
- `VERIFIED`: acceptance criteria passed in the required evidence tier.
- `PARTIAL`: some behavior exists, but acceptance criteria are incomplete.
- `PLANNED`: specified but not implemented.
- `BLOCKED`: cannot continue without a named decision, credential, service, or external action.
- `DEFERRED`: intentionally outside the active phase.

“Build passes” does not mean a page, workflow, security control, deployment, or scoring claim is verified.

## 3. Current-state baseline

The current repository contains a React Router SSR application, an authenticated `/api/analyze` resource action, all-page PDF text extraction through `unpdf`, heuristic parsing, versioned deterministic rules, an OpenAI structured-output pass, durable Supabase-backed analysis/job state, and a browser-side result cache over server-owned results.

### What is currently working

- TypeScript typecheck and production compilation.
- Synthetic extraction, parsing, rule, and non-LLM pipeline self-checks.
- Authenticated, rate-limited, consent-gated durable analysis ingestion with private storage and idempotency.
- Leased analysis and privacy workers with retry, cancellation, retention, export, deletion, and audit boundaries.
- Security headers, same-origin enforcement, bounded sessions, PII-safe telemetry, health/readiness, and protected metrics.
- Unit/integration/browser/accessibility/benchmark/load/restore checks wired into CI.
- Browser and upload rendering at laptop and mobile widths.

### Known release blockers

- The current deterministic score is a nine-rule synthetic-regression baseline with hand-authored weights, not a representative industry-calibrated score.
- The current prominent overall score mixes deterministic ATS rules with LLM category ratings; Accuracy-v2 must separate these semantics before broader scoring claims.
- OCR is safely refused by the default unsupported adapter. Scanned/mixed resume completion requires an approved provider/local engine, calibrated confidence policy, and representative corpus.
- The current skill taxonomy and synthetic matching corpus do not establish cross-industry requirement coverage.
- The current writer is a bounded copy-suggestion view, not a structured same-page resume editor or verified document generator.
- Production start requires explicit secret/config injection; it does not load a developer `.env` implicitly.
- Malware scanning, parser sandboxing, restricted worker egress, and container/runtime policy remain deployment-owned controls.
- The checked-in Phase 7 migrations are applied to the configured hosted project and the hosted schema, tenant/RLS, private-storage, and Phase 4 persistence smoke checks pass. The local Supabase database also resets cleanly through the current migration set and passes the SQL verification/lint gates.
- Live OpenAI verification is blocked by the configured model credential returning HTTP 401. Malware scanning, parser sandboxing, restricted worker egress, and container/runtime policy remain deployment-owned controls. Hosted restore, monitored staging E2E, alert notification delivery, rollback rehearsal, privacy-policy approval, and human security/operations approval remain open A4 evidence.
- In-process metrics reset on restart and require a deployment scrape/sink; replacing them with a managed backend is deferred until measured scale requires it.

## 4. Architecture principles

1. **Modular monolith first.** One web deployable and one worker deployable may share domain packages. Do not split into microservices without measured scaling or ownership pressure.
2. **Thin routes, explicit services.** Routes authenticate, validate, authorize, call an application service, and map typed errors to HTTP responses.
3. **Deterministic scoring owns numeric ATS compatibility.** LLM output may explain or critique; it must not silently override deterministic evidence.
4. **All external values are untrusted.** This includes PDFs, job descriptions, model responses, webhooks, environment variables, and stored JSON.
5. **Persist state before navigation.** A result URL must be durable, authorized, refreshable, and return a real 404 when absent.
6. **Version everything affecting a score.** Parser, rules, prompt, schema, model, and normalization versions are recorded with every analysis.
7. **Privacy by minimization.** Store only required data, define retention before collection, and make export/deletion testable.
8. **Accessible and reduced-motion by default.** Animations enhance state changes but never hide meaning or block task completion.
9. **Observable and reversible releases.** No release without health signals, dashboards, a rollback procedure, and an owner.
10. **Evidence before score.** Missing, conflicting, unsupported, or low-confidence critical evidence produces verification or no-score states, never an arbitrary low score.
11. **Canonical content before presentation.** Resume facts and versions live in template-independent structured data; PDF, DOCX, HTML, and LaTeX are generated artifacts.
12. **Verify every export.** A successful render or compile is not proof of ATS readability; generated artifacts are parsed back and compared before a verified label.
13. **Claims follow evidence.** Synthetic regression, representative-corpus validation, domain validation, vendor observation, and outcome calibration are distinct claim levels.

## 5. Capability map

Stable module IDs must be used in specs, tasks, telemetry, and ownership records.

| Module ID                   | Responsibility                                                                | Depends on                                               |

| `document-evidence`         | Native/OCR evidence, geometry, reading order, confidence, correction          | resume-ingestion, analysis-orchestration                 |
| `canonical-resume`          | Structured resume facts, immutable versions, provenance, change ledger        | document-evidence, persistence-history                   |

| `persistence-history`       | Resumes, jobs, analyses, versions, deletion/export                            | identity-tenancy                                         |
| `web-experience`            | Home, upload, progress, result/editor, errors, accessibility, responsive UI   | identity-tenancy, persistence-history, resume-authoring  |
| `observability-operations`  | Logs, metrics, traces, health, SLOs, alerts, runbooks                         | platform-foundation                                      |
| `privacy-security`          | Consent, retention, encryption, audit, threat model, security controls        | all core modules                                         |
| `billing-entitlements`      | Plans, quotas, metering, invoices, webhook processing                         | identity-tenancy, persistence-history                    |
| `enterprise-administration` | Enterprise workspaces, SSO/SAML, audit export, policy controls, integrations  | identity-tenancy, privacy-security, billing-entitlements |
| `recruiter-calibration`     | Human-authored job rubric, oversight, correction/appeal, named ATS pilots     | all candidate modules, enterprise-administration         |

Build order:

`platform-foundation` → `identity-tenancy` + `persistence-history` → `resume-ingestion` → `analysis-orchestration` → `document-evidence` → `canonical-resume` + `job-intelligence` → `scoring-evaluation` → `qualitative-ai` + `resume-authoring` → `verified-rendering` + `web-experience` → `privacy-security` + `observability-operations` → `billing-entitlements` → `enterprise-administration` → `recruiter-calibration`.

Security, privacy, testing, and observability are threaded through every slice even though they have named modules.

### Deployable units

1. **Web service**: SSR pages, authenticated API/resource routes, upload initiation, result reads, user actions, health/readiness.
2. **Analysis worker**: claims jobs, extracts and normalizes documents, runs deterministic scoring, calls the LLM adapter, persists results.
3. **Managed data services**: PostgreSQL, private object storage, identity provider, secret manager, telemetry backend.

The web and worker share TypeScript domain packages and schemas. They are separate processes so long PDF/AI work never holds an HTTP request open.

## 7. Repository target structure

```

Feature-specific logic must not be moved into generic utilities. Git, database, storage, AI, and authentication calls stay behind explicit server adapters.

## 8. Data architecture

All tables use server-generated UUIDs, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and explicit tenant/user ownership. Sensitive records use least-privilege access and audit trails.

| Entity                      | Required fields                                                        | Notes                                                                |

### Invariants

- A user may read a resume only through an active membership in its organization and an allowed role.
- Storage keys are generated by the server and never accepted directly from clients.
- Resume files are private; access uses short-lived signed URLs or authenticated streaming.
- Completed results are immutable. Re-analysis creates a new analysis record.
- The original uploaded resume version is immutable. Authoring creates canonical child versions; restore also creates a child rather than mutating history.
- Every scored finding and accepted generated fact resolves to source evidence or explicit candidate confirmation.
- Generated artifacts are not labelled verified until their parse-back policy passes.
- Delete requests remove active records and enqueue object, cache, index, and backup-retention actions.
- Every score stores `parser_version`, `ruleset_version`, `normalizer_version`, `prompt_version`, `schema_version`, and `model_id`.

## 9. Analysis lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CREATED
    CREATED --> UPLOADING
    UPLOADING --> QUARANTINED
    QUARANTINED --> QUEUED: validation passed
    QUARANTINED --> REJECTED: invalid or unsafe file
    QUEUED --> EXTRACTING
    EXTRACTING --> SCORING
    SCORING --> QUALITATIVE_REVIEW
    QUALITATIVE_REVIEW --> COMPLETED
    EXTRACTING --> NEEDS_OCR
    NEEDS_OCR --> SCORING
    EXTRACTING --> FAILED
    SCORING --> FAILED
    QUALITATIVE_REVIEW --> PARTIAL: deterministic result available
    QUALITATIVE_REVIEW --> FAILED
    CREATED --> CANCELLED
    QUEUED --> CANCELLED
```

Rules:

- State changes use transactions and compare-and-set semantics.
- Workers claim jobs with a lease and heartbeat; abandoned leases can be retried.
- Idempotency prevents duplicate uploads, jobs, AI calls, results, and billing events.
- Retry only transient failures with capped exponential backoff and jitter.
- Deterministic results may be returned as `PARTIAL` when the LLM provider is unavailable.
- Permanent errors use stable public codes; internal stack/provider details stay in protected logs.

### Accuracy-v2 and authoring lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> EVIDENCE_EXTRACTING
    EVIDENCE_EXTRACTING --> EVIDENCE_REVIEW: confidence/critical disagreement
    EVIDENCE_EXTRACTING --> CANONICAL_READY: evidence gate passed
    EVIDENCE_REVIEW --> CANONICAL_READY: candidate confirmed/corrected
    EVIDENCE_REVIEW --> UNSUPPORTED: evidence remains insufficient
    CANONICAL_READY --> SCORED
    SCORED --> EDITING
    EDITING --> CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED: rewrite needs a new fact
    CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED --> EDITING: candidate confirms/corrects/declines

    RENDERING --> VERIFYING_ARTIFACT
    VERIFYING_ARTIFACT --> EXPORT_READY: parse-back passed
    VERIFYING_ARTIFACT --> EXPORT_FAILED: parity/compile/accessibility failure
```

The state names above are target domain states, not evidence that corresponding database columns or routes exist. The original upload remains immutable throughout the authoring lifecycle.

## 10. API and route contracts

All JSON errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UPLOAD_TOO_LARGE",
    "message": "The PDF exceeds the allowed size.",
    "requestId": "req_...",
    "retryable": false
  }
}
```

Target routes:

| Method and route                    | Purpose                          | Success | Required controls                               |

The first implementation may upload through the web service for simplicity. Direct-to-object-storage uploads become necessary only when measured file volume justifies them.

## 11. Scoring architecture

The full target contract is [`docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_SPEC.md`](docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_SPEC.md). ADR-0006 is proposed and does not alter shipped score semantics until accepted and implemented.

### Evidence Confidence

Evidence Confidence is not candidate merit and does not contribute points. It gates whether other dimensions may be calculated. It combines calibrated page/word/field extraction evidence, native/OCR disagreements, reading-order uncertainty, critical-field completeness, job-requirement extraction confidence, and candidate confirmation.

`review_required`, `insufficient`, and `unsupported` are visible states. They must not be translated into low ATS or job-alignment scores.

### ATS Compatibility

The deterministic engine owns the numeric cross-system document compatibility index. It evaluates observable parse properties only:

- Page/text completeness, reading order, standard sections, contact fields, roles/employers, dates, bullets, and links.
- Columns, tables, text boxes, headers/footers, images, hidden/overlaid text, font/encoding, and file risks.
- Locale-specific parsing under a declared supported profile.
- Generated-artifact parse-back parity.

Rules retain exact evidence and policy versions. `not_evaluated` leaves the denominator and never earns free points. The score is not a qualification score or employer-pass probability.

### Job Alignment

The deterministic engine evaluates verified resume facts against typed job requirements. It separates required, preferred, contextual, unknown, and not-applicable requirements; exact, approved-alias, semantic-proposal, and recruiter-confirmed mappings; and satisfied, partial, confirmation-required, not-evidenced, and not-evaluated states.

Repeated terms and aliases cannot receive duplicate credit. Skills listed without supporting experience may count as weaker evidence but not as proven proficiency. Years, dates, education, certifications, location, authorization, and travel are typed comparisons rather than keywords.

The exact job description is the primary source. O*NET, ESCO, and approved domain packs normalize concepts. Market-frequency claims require dated permissioned data with sample/query provenance. Recruiter-authored calibration is deferred behind the enterprise/fairness gate.

### Optional Application Readiness

A combined candidate progress index may be tested only after comprehension research. If introduced, it is deterministic, exposes its components/confidence, is withheld with insufficient evidence, and is labelled `Application Readiness`. It must not be called an employer ATS score or interview probability.

### Qualitative AI and authoring layer

- The provider adapter accepts a typed request and returns a typed result.
- Resume/JD content is untrusted data and is clearly separated from system instructions.
- Structured output is validated again at the service boundary.
- Calls have input/output token caps, timeouts, retry classification, usage capture, and per-tenant budgets.
- No secret, cross-tenant context, or unnecessary PII enters the prompt.
- Every proposed factual statement cites canonical fact IDs; unsupported claims are rejected or converted into candidate clarification questions.
- Candidate-visible accept/edit/reject/undo events are immutable. The LLM cannot silently mutate the canonical resume.
- XYZ is one writing pattern; verified impact and scope are preferred, but a number is never fabricated or universally required.
- The user's four-level prompt becomes a typed result view: version/evidence state, blockers, at most five highest-impact changes, reliable strengths, missing/confirmation-required evidence, and server-supplied score fields. The LLM may narrate these objects but cannot calculate or replace their numeric values.
- Provider refusal or outage preserves deterministic results and manual editing.
- A provider/model/prompt change requires a locked writer evaluation and a versioned rollout.
- LLM category scores do not own ATS Compatibility, Job Alignment, or authoritative Application Readiness.

### Accuracy evidence and claim ladder

Maintain consented, licensed, synthetic, or irreversibly anonymized corpora covering clean, multi-page, multi-column, scanned, mixed, malformed, encrypted, international, sparse, long, adversarial, and generated documents. Development, calibration, and locked test partitions remain separate.

Track character/word error, page coverage, reading order, field precision/recall, requirement/importance F1, evidence precision/recall, deterministic variance, expert agreement, unsupported-fact rate, render parity, counterfactual invariance, failure rate, latency, and cost. Report per-segment metrics and confidence intervals; an aggregate cannot hide a failed segment.

Allowed claim levels are `Regression-tested` → `Corpus-validated` → `Domain-validated` → `Vendor-observed` → `Outcome-calibrated`. Product language may use only the achieved level. Current Phase 5 evidence is `Regression-tested`.

### Accessibility and motion contract

- WCAG 2.2 AA target.
- Every route has one `<h1>`, unique title, logical landmarks, and a skip link.
- Visible `:focus-visible` styles are never removed without replacement.
- Errors are programmatically associated with fields and announced through `aria-live`.
- Accordions expose `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, stable IDs, and regions.
- Scores and progress expose accessible names, values, and text equivalents.
- Color is never the only signal.
- Animation honors `prefers-reduced-motion`; task completion never depends on animation.
- Layout and motion verification covers 390, 768, 1024, 1366, and 1440 CSS-pixel widths.

## 13. Security and privacy architecture

### Trust boundaries

1. Browser to web service.
2. Web/worker to database and object storage.
3. Worker to PDF/OCR libraries.
4. Worker to LLM provider.
5. Billing and identity webhooks to web service.
6. Tenant administrators to enterprise policy controls.
7. Worker to document/OCR provider and taxonomy/market-data source.
8. Worker to PDF/DOCX renderer and isolated LaTeX compiler.

### Required controls

- Secure, HTTP-only, SameSite session cookies; rotation and bounded lifetime.
- Authorization in every loader/action/service, with tenant isolation tested at both application and data-policy layers.
- CSRF/origin checks for state-changing browser requests.
- CSP, HSTS, frame, MIME-sniffing, referrer, and permissions headers.
- Secrets from a managed secret store; startup validation; no `.env` in Docker contexts.
- File/body/page/text/token/time limits before expensive work.
- Quarantine and sandboxing for PDFs; malware scanning based on deployment risk.
- Renderer inputs come from validated canonical data; LaTeX uses allowlisted templates/packages, complete escaping, no shell escape/network/host access, and hard process/resource limits.
- Generated artifacts remain private and are not recommended until parse-back verification passes.
- Shared rate limits, quotas, concurrency caps, and provider cost kill switches.
- Encryption in transit and at rest, short-lived signed URLs, and access audit.
- Generic client errors and structured protected logs with PII redaction.
- Explicit consent before LLM transfer, documented purpose, retention, subprocessor record, export, correction, and deletion.
- Dependency, provenance, container, and secret scanning in CI.

## 14. Reliability, performance, and observability

Initial SLOs are proposals and require human approval plus measured baselines:

| Signal                   | Proposed objective                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Web availability         | 99.9% monthly for authenticated core pages                         |
| Non-analysis API latency | p95 under 500 ms excluding upload transfer                         |
| Analysis acceptance      | p95 under 1 s to create a durable queued job                       |
| Analysis completion      | p95 target established from corpus before launch                   |
| Job terminal-state rate  | At least 99% complete, partial, rejected, or explicit failed state |
| Cross-tenant access      | Zero tolerated                                                     |
| Data-loss objective      | RPO and RTO explicitly approved after restore drill                |

Required telemetry:

- Structured logs with request, tenant, user, analysis, run, and correlation IDs; never raw resume text.
- RED metrics for routes and worker stages.
- Queue depth, lease age, retry count, provider error, token usage, and cost metrics.
- Browser Core Web Vitals and client error reporting with PII scrubbing.
- Alerts on symptoms: sustained error rate, stalled jobs, queue age, cost anomaly, readiness failure, and SLO burn.
- Runbooks for provider outage, worker backlog, corrupt upload, compromised key, failed migration, and rollback.

Static hashed assets receive immutable caching. Large GIFs should be replaced with optimized video/WebP or CSS motion; the PDF worker should be versioned and cached.

## 15. Deployment architecture

- Reproducible frozen install in CI.
- Supported runtime version pinned across local development, CI, and containers.
- Multi-stage container with minimal runtime files, non-root user, init/signal handling, health check, and immutable base-image digest policy.
- Separate web and worker commands from the same tested artifact, deployed initially as Fly.io process groups in Mumbai.
- Environment-specific configuration from a secret/config manager.
- Managed TLS, CDN/static caching, web application firewall where appropriate, and restricted egress from workers.
- Forward-compatible database migrations with expand/migrate/contract sequencing.
- Staging smoke tests, production canary, monitored rollout, and tested rollback.
- Backups are not considered valid until a restore drill passes.

| Performance     | Web and worker corpus benchmarks                            | Core Web Vitals, extraction/AI latency, memory, concurrency, cost                                      |

| Metamorphic     | Semantics-preserving and adversarial transformations        | Whitespace/order/alias stability, duplication, stuffing, prompt injection, protected-name substitution |
| Corpus validity | Locked representative per-segment evaluation                | Native/OCR error, field/requirement F1, evidence validity, expert agreement, confidence intervals      |
| Artifact        | Render/compile and parse-back verification                  | Critical fields, text/order/link parity, overflow, A4/Letter, accessibility, resource limits           |
| External        | Named domain, recruiter panel, and ATS/provider environment | Construct validity, vendor-observed behavior, limitations, reproducibility                             |

No gate is passed by documentation alone. A human owner records approval and links the evidence.

## 18. Approved decisions and open questions

The workspace owner approved the following candidate B2C baseline on 2026-09-09:

- Node.js 22 LTS; React Router modular monolith with separate web and worker processes.
- Fly.io deployment in Mumbai; Supabase PostgreSQL 17, Auth, and private Storage in `ap-south-1`.
- PostgreSQL-backed leased jobs sized initially for 100 analyses per day and five concurrent analyses.
- Thirty-day active resume retention, immediate removal of active access after deletion, and provider-governed backup expiry.
- 99.5% monthly availability, 24-hour RPO, and 4-hour RTO for the MVP.
- OCR remains disabled behind an adapter until a provider is separately selected.
- Portable SQL, storage, and identity adapters preserve a vendor-exit path.
- The workspace owner holds product, privacy/security, scoring-quality, cost, operations, and release ownership until delegated.
- The existing A3 result is approved only as a synthetic regression gate. Accuracy-v2 architecture, representative-corpus validity, and industry/vendor claims remain proposed and open.

Still required to close Gate A0:

1. Approve maximum analysis duration, retry count, and dead-letter procedure.
2. Approve ADR-0006 score separation, legacy-score treatment, evidence gating, dimensions/weights, and user-facing claim language. No LLM-generated score weight is proposed.
3. Define the initial B2C payment model and entitlement limits.
4. Approve the first Accuracy-v2 occupation/domain, locale, OCR/provider bake-off, corpus governance, and artifact-format scope at Gate AA0.

Until those decisions are approved, implementation must preserve current provider and claim boundaries. Accuracy-v2 tasks remain planned and no industry, vendor, or outcome-calibrated claim is authorized.
