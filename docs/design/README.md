# Resumide Design System

Status: design implementation complete across all routed surfaces. The category research is in [`COMPETITIVE_UX_RESEARCH.md`](COMPETITIVE_UX_RESEARCH.md), the concept decision is preserved in [`../archive/DESIGN_CONCEPTS.md`](../archive/DESIGN_CONCEPTS.md), and the final page structure and verification boundary are in [`PRODUCT_DESIGN_BLUEPRINT.md`](PRODUCT_DESIGN_BLUEPRINT.md). Public and signed-out flows pass responsive light/dark browser and accessibility checks. Seeded authenticated visual regression and field performance measurement remain verification work.

## Product thesis

Resumide makes the ATS black box visible. The interface should feel like a calm editorial review desk paired with a precise analysis instrument.

The memorable first impression is: **I can see exactly what the ATS saw, what failed, and what to fix next.**

The visual system is inspired by Claude's warm editorial restraint, but it is not an Anthropic clone. Resumide uses its own identity, type, iconography, data visuals, and product language.

## Design direction: Editorial Intelligence

- Warm, paper-like canvas for reading and reflection.
- Ink-like typography with coral action color and teal evidence color.
- Dense product areas use calm, flat surfaces instead of card mosaics.
- Glass is limited to navigation, floating controls, and overlays.
- 3D is used as a lightweight evidence language across the product: source documents, scan progress, score layers, privacy controls, and recovery states each have a purposeful scene.
- Gradients create atmosphere behind content. They never reduce text contrast or encode score meaning alone.
- Every important screen works completely without animation, blur, or WebGL.

## Experience principles

1. **Evidence before decoration.** Results prioritize the score explanation, parser evidence, and next actions.
2. **One dominant action per screen.** Upload, cancel, view result, retry, or apply a rewrite must be obvious.
3. **Progress is honest.** Show real stages and timestamps. Never show a fake percentage or fake ETA.
4. **Calm density.** Prefer aligned regions, dividers, and whitespace over stacking everything in rounded cards.
5. **Motion explains change.** Animation connects upload to processing to result. It does not delay access.
6. **Two designed themes.** Dark mode is not an inverted light mode. Both themes have intentional contrast and elevation.
7. **Trust at every edge.** Privacy, consent, partial results, limitations, and recovery actions stay visible.

## Theme architecture

Use semantic CSS variables. Components consume semantic tokens and never branch on literal light or dark colors.

Theme selection order:

1. Saved user preference.
2. System `prefers-color-scheme` preference.
3. Light theme fallback.

Apply the resolved theme before first paint. Persist it locally and, for signed-in users, in the account preference. The theme toggle has Light, Dark, and System options.

### Light theme

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
  --canvas: #f7f3ec;
  --canvas-subtle: #f1ebe2;
  --surface: #fcfaf6;
  --surface-raised: #ffffff;
  --surface-strong: #e9e1d5;
  --surface-inverse: #1b1a18;
  --glass: rgb(252 250 246 / 78%);
  --ink: #1b1b18;
  --ink-strong: #11110f;
  --ink-muted: #64615b;
  --ink-faint: #817d75;
  --ink-inverse: #faf7f1;
  --border: #dcd4c8;
  --border-strong: #c7bcad;

  --warning: #a66013;
  --danger: #b54545;
  --focus: #2563eb;
  --shadow-color: 25 22 18;
}
```

### Dark theme

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  color-scheme: dark;
  --canvas: #121210;
  --canvas-subtle: #171613;
  --surface: #1b1a17;
  --surface-raised: #23211e;
  --surface-strong: #2c2924;
  --surface-inverse: #f7f3ec;
  --glass: rgb(27 26 23 / 76%);
  --ink: #eee8de;
  --ink-strong: #fffaf2;
  --ink-muted: #aaa39a;
  --ink-faint: #8c857c;
  --ink-inverse: #191815;
  --border: #3d3932;
  --border-strong: #554f45;
  --brand: #e08a6d;
  --brand-hover: #ef9c7f;
  --brand-soft: #4a2b23;
  --evidence: #68b9ac;

  --success: #68b88b;
  --warning: #dda34f;
  --danger: #e37d7d;
  --focus: #8bb4ff;
  --shadow-color: 0 0 0;
}
```

### Gradient recipes

Use gradients only through named recipes:

- **Canvas aura:** three radial fields using coral, amber, and teal at 8 to 14 percent opacity. Decorative only.
- **Evidence glow:** teal radial gradient behind the parse comparison or keyword visualization. Maximum 12 percent opacity.
- **Action wash:** coral-to-warm-amber linear gradient for small emphasis bands, never for the primary button.
- **Score ring:** semantic conic segments with a visible numeric label and text status. Color is supplemental.
- **Dark depth:** warm graphite linear gradient from `--surface-raised` to `--canvas`, with a 1px border.

Do not use purple-blue AI gradients, full-screen blur, animated gradient text, or gradients behind long-form text.

## Typography

- **Display:** Newsreader Variable, weights 450 to 600. Editorial but highly readable.
- **Interface and body:** Manrope Variable, weights 400 to 700.
- **Evidence and numeric data:** IBM Plex Mono, weights 400 to 600, with tabular numbers.
- Self-host WOFF2 subsets. Preload only the primary UI regular and medium faces.

Type scale:

| Token      | Desktop | Mobile | Use                       |
| ---------- | ------: | -----: | ------------------------- |
| Display    |   64/66 |  42/44 | Marketing hero only       |
| H1         |   44/50 |  34/40 | Page title                |
| H2         |   32/38 |  27/33 | Major workspace region    |
| H3         |   22/29 |  20/27 | Result section            |
| Body large |   18/29 |  17/27 | Introductory copy         |
| Body       |   16/25 |  16/25 | Default content           |
| Small      |   14/21 |  14/21 | Secondary metadata        |
| Label      |   13/18 |  13/18 | UI labels and badges      |
| Data       |   14/22 |  13/20 | Parser evidence and trace |

Headings use balanced wrapping where supported. Body copy is capped at 68 characters per line. Scores and percentages use tabular numbers.

## Layout and spacing

- 4px base unit.
- Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96.
- App shell max width: 1440px.
- Reading/result column max width: 760px.
- Marketing content max width: 1200px.
- Desktop grid: 12 columns with 24px gutters.
- Tablet grid: 8 columns with 20px gutters.
- Mobile grid: 4 columns with 16px gutters.
- Touch target minimum: 44 by 44px.

Radius is hierarchical, not bubbly:

- Controls: 8px.
- Panels: 12px.
- Hero artifact and large modal: 18px.
- Pills: status labels only.

Use 1px borders and surface contrast before shadows. Limit shadows to floating overlays and the 3D resume artifact.

## App shell and navigation

### Public and authentication shell

- 64px top navigation with wordmark, Product, How scoring works, Privacy, theme control, and one Analyze Resume CTA.
- Navigation may use restrained glass over the canvas aura. Fallback is an opaque surface.
- On mobile, use a clear menu sheet. Do not hide the primary Analyze action.

### Signed-in workspace shell

- Desktop: 232px left rail with Resumes, New analysis, Account, Privacy, and future Billing.
- Tablet: 72px icon rail with accessible labels.
- Mobile: top app bar plus four-item bottom navigation. New analysis remains the emphasized action.
- The content header owns the page title, status, and primary action. Do not repeat the same title inside a card.

## Page-by-page blueprint

### Home `/`

Purpose: orient the user and resume useful work in under five seconds.

First visual order:

1. `Resume workspace` heading and Analyze Resume action.
2. Latest analysis with score, status, target job, and Continue/View Result action.
3. Paginated analysis history.

Replace the large resume card grid with a responsive list or table. Each row shows resume name, target role/company, overall score, status, updated date, and overflow actions. On mobile, each row becomes a compact two-line item, not a decorative card.

Empty state: a small 3D paper stack, `Run your first ATS visibility check`, a one-sentence explanation, and the Analyze Resume button.

### Sign in `/auth`

Purpose: establish trust and finish authentication with minimal friction.

- Two-column composition on desktop: concise trust statement and product artifact on the left, email magic-link form on the right.
- Single focused form on mobile.
- Explain why sign-in is needed: durable private results and cross-device history.
- Success state replaces the form with a clear email check state and resend timer.
- Invalid or expired links offer resend, change email, and return actions.

### Upload `/upload`

Purpose: submit a resume and optional job context confidently.

- Desktop split: 7-column form and 5-column live summary/preview.
- Section 1: Target job, explicitly marked optional.
- Section 2: Resume PDF dropzone with file metadata and replace/remove controls.
- Section 3: AI consent and privacy disclosure in plain language.
- Sticky submission footer shows file readiness, expected next step, and Analyze Resume.
- Validate each section inline. Keep user input after recoverable failures.

The dropzone is a tactile paper tray. On drag, the top paper rises 4px and the border changes to evidence teal. No full-panel blur or bouncing animation.

### Analysis progress `/analysis/:id`

Purpose: reduce uncertainty during slow work and provide control.

- Left: lightweight 3D scan artifact made with CSS transforms and SVG scan line.
- Right: real stage timeline: Secure upload, Extract text, Parse structure, Score evidence, Generate feedback, Save result.
- Current stage has one active motion. Completed stages remain static.
- Show last update time and `You can safely leave this page` when processing is durable.
- Keep Cancel visible only while cancellation is valid.
- Partial, failed, cancelled, rejected, and needs-OCR states each get distinct explanation and next action.

### Result `/resume/:id`

Purpose: convert analysis into prioritized action, not an endless stack of cards.

Desktop composition:

- 5-column sticky resume viewer.
- 7-column analysis workspace.
- Sticky in-page tabs: Overview, ATS Evidence, Parse View, Keywords, Rewrite.
- Result header contains overall score, confidence/limitations, target job, and the three highest-impact actions.

Sections:

1. **Overview:** score breakdown, strengths, top fixes, and estimated impact.
2. **ATS Evidence:** deterministic checks with rule name, evidence, effect, and remediation.
3. **Parse View:** original and extracted structure synchronized by page and section. Warnings link to evidence.
4. **Keywords:** coverage groups, matched/missing terms, and context evidence. Call it Heatmap only after a real overlay exists.
5. **Rewrite:** original and suggested text in a diff-like layout with Copy, Accept, and Undo. Never imply invented experience is acceptable.

On mobile, the viewer becomes a Preview tab or full-screen sheet. Do not place a sticky 100vh PDF above or below all analysis content.

### Privacy `/privacy`

Purpose: make sensitive controls clear and recoverable.

- Explain retention and request consequences before actions.
- Separate Export data and Delete account into distinct rows.
- Deletion uses a confirmation dialog with re-authentication and explicit scope.
- Request history uses a status list with submitted date, current state, and completion details.

### Error, 404, and expired session

- Use the same shell and typography as the product.
- State what happened, what data is safe, and what the user can do next.
- Include a request ID for server errors.
- Never show a blank page, raw stack trace, or generic `Oops` in production.

### Future billing

- Calm plan comparison with one recommended plan, clear quota, renewal date, and invoice history.
- No dark-pattern urgency, hidden renewal terms, or decorative pricing card grid.

### Future enterprise administration

- Reuse the workspace rail.
- Members use a dense table with role, status, last activity, and actions.
- Policies, audit events, and retention settings use clear sections and change histories.
- Destructive controls are isolated from routine settings.

## Component vocabulary

- `AppShell`, `PublicShell`, `WorkspaceRail`, `MobileTabBar`
- `PageHeader`, `SectionHeader`, `ActionBar`
- `Button`, `IconButton`, `MenuButton`, `ThemeControl`
- `Field`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `FileDropzone`
- `StatusBadge`, `ScoreRing`, `ScoreBreakdown`, `ConfidenceLabel`
- `StageTimeline`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, `Skeleton`
- `ResumeViewer`, `EvidenceRow`, `ParseComparison`, `KeywordCoverage`
- `RewriteDiff`, `RequestHistory`, `DataTable`, `Dialog`, `Toast`

Cards are permitted only when the object itself is independently selectable or portable. Use sections and dividers for continuous analysis content.

## Glass, 3D, and motion rules

### Glass

Allowed:

- Top navigation.
- Result sub-navigation.
- Resume viewer controls.
- Modal or bottom-sheet chrome.

Not allowed:

- Form fields, score panels, evidence rows, tables, long-form content, or full-page backgrounds.
- More than two overlapping blurred surfaces.

Use `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` only on bounded elements. Provide an opaque fallback. Do not animate blur.

### 3D

Start with CSS 3D transforms and SVG, not Three.js.

- Hero: a three-layer resume stack showing source PDF, parser structure, and evidence overlay.
- Upload: one paper lift interaction on drag.
- Progress: a document plane with a single scan line linked to the real current stage.
- Results: a subtle perspective transition when switching between Resume and Parse layers.

Pointer tilt is desktop-only, max 4 degrees, updates through `requestAnimationFrame`, and stops when the element is offscreen. Disable it for touch, low-power preferences, reduced motion, and hidden tabs.

WebGL is a later enhancement only if it proves a clear improvement and adds no more than 80KB compressed to the initial experience. It must be lazy-loaded after the primary content is interactive.

### Motion tokens

```css
:root {
  --duration-instant: 80ms;
  --duration-fast: 140ms;
  --duration-base: 220ms;
  --duration-slow: 360ms;
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1);
}
```

- Hover and press: 80 to 140ms.
- Panel/tab transition: 180 to 220ms.
- Route/hero entrance: up to 360ms.
- Never use a one-second fade for standard content.
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` during routine interactions.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` removes parallax, tilt, scan travel, and stagger. State changes remain immediate and understandable.

## Interaction state contract

| Feature  | Loading                   | Empty                          | Error                       | Success                             | Partial                        |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| History  | Row skeletons             | First-analysis action          | Retry with preserved shell  | Paginated rows                      | Stale data label if cached     |
| Upload   | Button and local progress | Dropzone guidance              | Inline recovery             | Navigate to durable progress/result | Upload saved, analysis queued  |
| Progress | Initial status skeleton   | Not applicable                 | Retry or upload again       | View result                         | Deterministic result available |
| Result   | Section skeletons         | Honest no-evidence message     | Retry/read-safe recovery    | Prioritized analysis                | Missing AI sections labeled    |
| Parse    | Page skeleton             | No detected structure guidance | Page-level retry/error      | Synchronized evidence               | Unsupported pages labeled      |
| Keywords | Compact loader            | Add a job description          | Keep resume result usable   | Coverage plus context               | Some terms unavailable         |
| Rewrite  | Section loader            | No grounded rewrite available  | Retry without losing result | Copy/accept feedback                | Some suggestions unavailable   |
| Privacy  | Row skeletons             | No requests yet                | Clear retry                 | Request ID and state                | Processing state with timeline |

## Responsive behavior

Verify 390, 768, 1024, 1366, and 1440 CSS-pixel widths.

- Mobile navigation and result tabs are intentionally redesigned, not merely stacked.
- Data tables expose the same actions in compact rows.
- Charts and score visuals always have text equivalents.
- Resume preview opens in a sheet when space is constrained.
- No horizontal page scroll at 320px or 200 percent zoom.
- Touch targets remain at least 44px and do not depend on hover.

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 AA minimum.
- Body text contrast at least 4.5:1; large text at least 3:1; UI boundaries at least 3:1 where required.
- Visible focus ring uses `--focus` and is never removed.
- Theme control, tabs, accordions, dialogs, dropzone, score, and progress use correct keyboard and screen-reader patterns.
- Success, warning, and failure never rely on color alone.
- Live regions announce upload, processing, cancellation, and retry changes without repeating continuously.
- PDF preview is supplementary. Extracted text and findings remain accessible without it.

## Performance and reliability budget

User-facing targets on a mid-range mobile device and normal 4G:

- LCP under 2.5 seconds at p75.
- INP under 200ms at p75.
- CLS under 0.1 at p75.
- Initial route JavaScript under 170KB compressed, excluding route-lazy PDF tooling.
- Theme application before first paint with no visible flash.
- First useful server-rendered content does not wait for 3D, motion, PDF rendering, or AI calls.

Implementation constraints:

- Replace large GIF loaders with CSS/SVG motion or compact WebM/AVIF assets.
- Lazy-load PDF rendering and result-only visualization code.
- Do not load a global animation runtime for simple transitions.
- Use route-level code splitting and defer non-critical result sections.
- Pause polling and animation in hidden tabs.
- Use fixed media dimensions to prevent layout shift.
- Use `content-visibility: auto` for long result sections only after accessibility testing.
- Blur is bounded and disabled on constrained devices when it harms frame time.
- Every route has a branded error boundary and a useful retry or recovery action.

## Rollout plan

### Phase D0: Baseline and design acceptance

- Capture current screenshots and Core Web Vitals at the five target widths.
- Approve light and dark tokens, typography, and the result information hierarchy.
- Create one high-fidelity result screen and one upload/progress flow before broad implementation.

### Phase D1: Foundation

- Add semantic tokens, font loading, theme bootstrap, theme control, and reduced-motion rules.
- Build the public and signed-in shells.
- Add Storybook or an equivalent component preview only if it is maintained by tests.

### Phase D2: Critical journey

- Redesign Upload, Analysis Progress, and Result first.
- Prove direct-open, refresh, partial-result, error, cancel, and mobile behavior.
- Keep current data contracts stable unless a separately approved product change is required.

### Phase D3: Supporting routes

- Redesign Home, Auth, Privacy, error, 404, and expired-session states.
- Replace card grids with lists, aligned regions, and intentional empty states.

### Phase D4: Motion and 3D enhancement

- Add CSS 3D resume artifact and stage-linked scan motion.
- Measure frame rate, INP, power use, and reduced-motion behavior before enabling by default.
- Use a feature flag or kill switch for expensive enhancements.

### Phase D5: Production hardening

- Run visual regression, keyboard, screen-reader, axe, theme, zoom, and browser tests.
- Enforce performance budgets in CI.
- Validate both themes for every loading, empty, error, success, and partial state.

## Acceptance gates

The redesign is ready to ship only when:

- The critical journey works with JavaScript-delayed enhancements and reduced motion.
- Light and dark screenshots are approved at all target widths.
- There is no theme flash, unreadable gradient text, or color-only status.
- Upload, progress, result, privacy, 404, and authentication recovery states pass browser tests.
- The result page exposes the three highest-impact actions before detailed findings.
- The Parse View clearly distinguishes simulation from proprietary ATS behavior.
- Performance targets pass on production builds, not only development builds.
- A human approves the design gate before page-by-page implementation expands.

## Explicitly not in the first redesign slice

- Full WebGL scenes.
- Constant cursor-following effects.
- Animated backgrounds behind forms or analysis text.
- New billing or enterprise product behavior.
- Rewriting scoring, persistence, or worker architecture as a side effect of visual work.
- Copying Anthropic logos, marks, proprietary fonts, or exact layouts.
