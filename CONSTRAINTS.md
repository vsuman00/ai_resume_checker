# Resumide constraints

Status: **CURRENT ENGINEERING FLOOR PLUS PROPOSED ACCURACY-V2 GATES**
Last reviewed: 2026-09-11 by Codex; human quality approval pending for proposed gates

This file records the quality bar. It must not be weakened to make an implementation pass. A proposed gate is not enforced evidence until its named checker exists and runs against the required corpus.

## 1. Floor

- No new `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, skipped tests, deleted assertions, empty catches, or unimplemented production stubs without a reviewed exception.
- No secrets, resume text, job-description text, provider prompts, or candidate PII in source, logs, metrics, fixtures, screenshots, or telemetry.
- No numeric ATS/job-alignment score may be owned or silently changed by an LLM.
- No generated candidate fact may be accepted without source evidence or explicit candidate confirmation.
- No score may be shown when its critical extraction inputs are known to be incomplete or unreliable.
- No product or marketing claim may exceed the achieved claim level in `docs/ATS_SCORING_AND_AUTHORING_SPEC.md`.
- No real resume/job corpus may be collected or reused without documented permission, purpose, retention, and deletion policy.
- This file and benchmark thresholds may be tightened through review; relaxing them requires a named owner, rationale, evidence, and expiry or replacement target.

| Formatting                          | Repository files in the formatter target have no drift     | `npm run format:check`                                                                       | task end, CI |
| Lint                                | Zero configured lint errors                                | `npm run lint`                                                                               | task end, CI |
| Types                               | Zero TypeScript/type-generation errors                     | `npm run typecheck`                                                                          | task end, CI |
| Tests                               | No failing committed Vitest tests                          | `npm run test`                                                                               | task end, CI |

| Synthetic parser/matcher regression | Existing approved Phase 5 thresholds do not regress        | `npm run benchmark:phase5`                                                                   | CI           |
| Browser/accessibility regression    | Existing Playwright/axe gates pass                         | `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run test:a11y`                                                   | CI           |
| Security floor                      | Existing secret, container, and high dependency gates pass | `npm run scan:secrets`, `npm run check:container`, `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` | CI           |

The Phase 5 benchmark is explicitly a synthetic regression check. Passing it does not satisfy the Accuracy-v2 validity gates below.

## 3. Proposed Accuracy-v2 release gates

These targets apply per released segment, not only in aggregate. A segment includes the declared occupation/domain, language/locale, document class, and scan/layout class. Final thresholds require human approval after the benchmark design and baselines are reviewed.

| Dimension                  | Proposed gate                                                                                                                           | Reason                                                                                                                             | Planned checker                      |

| Critical field extraction  | Precision at least 98% and recall at least 97% for name, email, phone, employer, role, dates, education, and certifications             | False facts and missing qualifications both harm candidate trust                                                                   | `npm run benchmark:extraction-v2`    |

| Evidence citation          | 100% precision and at least 98% recall for source spans attached to scored findings and requirements                                    | Every displayed scoring claim must be inspectable; missing non-critical evidence is measured separately                            | `npm run benchmark:scoring-validity` |
| Unsupported accepted facts | Zero unsupported facts in the locked release corpus and runtime rejection of unsupported generated facts                                | One invented employer, metric, certification, or skill can harm a candidate                                                        | `npm run benchmark:writer-grounding` |

## 4. Corpus and statistical constraints

- Development, calibration, and locked test partitions are separate; near-duplicate resumes and templates cannot cross partitions.
- Critical labels use at least two independent annotators and adjudication. Target inter-annotator agreement is at least 0.80 using an appropriate documented statistic because lower agreement means the rubric is not stable enough to calibrate a score.
- Scoped local-testing exception E-002 permits AI-assisted labels with known synthetic source truth. Such records explicitly lack independent-human validation; they cannot satisfy the representative release/calibration requirements above or establish human agreement. See [ADR-0010](docs/decisions/0010-ai-assisted-synthetic-annotation.md).
- Metrics report document-level bootstrap 95% confidence intervals and per-segment results.
- Sample size is justified through a documented precision/power calculation. The planning floor of roughly 203 independent documents per released segment estimates a 95% binomial success rate within approximately ±3 percentage points at 95% confidence; final analysis must account for clustering and non-binomial metrics.
- A segment cannot be declared supported when its lower confidence bound misses an approved gate, even if the global aggregate passes.
- Vendor-specific claims require a named ATS/version, controlled test protocol, and reproducible evidence. General compatibility tests cannot be relabelled as vendor verification.
- Interview/callback outcomes cannot be used as the sole ground truth because they are confounded by employer, market, timing, referral, candidate, and human-review factors.

## 5. Performance and cost targets for the new workflow

These are proposed product targets and must be baselined before enforcement:

| Dimension                                    | Proposed target                                                                                           | Reason                                                                               | Planned checker                                 |

| Standard two-page analysis completion        | p95 target set after OCR/provider bake-off; no invented number before measurement                         | Provider and scan behavior must determine the budget                                 | `npm run benchmark:extraction-v2`               |
| LLM factual drafting                         | One bounded request for the normal path; escalation only for low-confidence cases                         | Controls free-product cost and latency without letting the cheap model own the score | `npm run benchmark:writer-grounding`            |
| Compile/render                               | p95 target set after renderer selection; hard timeout and resource cap required from first implementation | LaTeX/DOCX/PDF paths have different costs and risks                                  | `npm run benchmark:render-parity`               |
