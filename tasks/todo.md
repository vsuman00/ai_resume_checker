# Resumide Enterprise Implementation Tasks

Status: **PARTIAL; CANDIDATE B2C BASELINE IMPLEMENTED; ACCURACY-V2 DIRECTION APPROVED; AA010 IMPLEMENTED; CONCRETE AA0 DECISIONS AND A0/A4 OPEN**
Plan: [`plan.md`](plan.md)
Accuracy-v2 subplan: [`accuracy-authoring-plan.md`](accuracy-authoring-plan.md)
Architecture: [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Task rules

- Work in numeric dependency order unless a task explicitly says it can run in parallel.
- One task equals one focused, reviewable change. Split it if it exceeds five likely files.
- Check a task only after all acceptance and verification items pass.
- A checkbox proves only the named evidence tier. Live-provider, browser, staging, restore, and production checks remain separate.
- Update this file in the same change that completes a task.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work. Do not stage, commit, deploy, or push unless explicitly authorized.

## Gate A0 decision record - 2026-09-09

- Approved by the workspace owner: candidate B2C-first product; Node.js 22 LTS; Fly.io web/worker process groups in Mumbai; Supabase PostgreSQL 17, Auth, and private Storage in `ap-south-1`; modular monolith with PostgreSQL-backed jobs.
- Approved operating baseline: 30-day active resume retention, immediate removal of active access after deletion, provider-window backup expiry, 100 analyses/day, five concurrent analyses, 99.5% monthly availability, 24-hour RPO, and 4-hour RTO.
- OCR is disabled behind an adapter. The workspace owner holds product, privacy/security, scoring, cost, operations, and release ownership until delegated.
- Deferred: enterprise administration, enterprise roles, and employer workflows. Do not create an admin surface in the active build.
- Still unresolved: maximum job duration/retry/dead-letter policy, scoring weights/skipped-rule/claim-language approval, and the B2C payment/entitlement model.
- Accuracy-v2 architectural direction and AA010 were approved on 2026-10-03. The first domain/locale, detailed corpus governance, OCR bake-off, calibrated score policy, and release-format acceptance remain open AA0 decisions.
- The hosted Resumide Supabase project is active; initial migration, RLS, private bucket, and advisory checks passed through Supabase MCP.

### T011: Add typed runtime configuration and startup validation

**Dependencies:** T010
**Likely files:** `app/lib/server/config.ts`, `app/lib/server/analyze.ts`, `.env.example`, `package.json`
**Scope:** M

- [x] Parse required/optional environment values once with a schema and redacted errors.
- [x] Production startup/readiness fails when required secrets or invalid limits are missing.
- [x] Local production and container instructions inject environment explicitly.
- **Verify:** tests cover valid, missing, malformed, and secret-redaction cases; production server works with injected test config and fails safely without it.

### T012: Establish stable server error contracts and request IDs

**Dependencies:** T011
**Likely files:** `app/lib/server/errors.ts`, `app/lib/server/request-context.ts`, `app/root.tsx`, `app/routes/api.analyze.ts`
**Scope:** M

- [x] Public responses use stable codes, safe messages, request IDs, and retryability.
- [x] Provider/parser stacks remain in protected logs only.
- [x] GET on POST-only resources returns 405 plus `Allow: POST`.
- **Verify:** integration tests assert 400/401/403/404/405/413/422/429/500/503 bodies and confirm no key, prompt, stack, or raw PDF text leaks.

### T013: Add liveness, readiness, and graceful shutdown

**Dependencies:** T011
**Likely files:** `app/routes/healthz.ts`, `app/routes/readyz.ts`, `app/routes.ts`, server entry/config
**Scope:** M

- [x] `/healthz` checks process liveness without exposing dependencies.
- [x] `/readyz` performs bounded required-dependency checks and returns 503 when unavailable.
- [x] SIGTERM stops new work and allows bounded request completion.
- **Verify:** curl status/body tests, dependency-failure test, and local termination test.

### T014: Enforce server input and cost boundaries

**Dependencies:** T011, T012
**Likely files:** `app/routes/api.analyze.ts`, `app/lib/server/upload-validation.ts`, `app/lib/server/analyze.ts`, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Enforce request bytes before buffering, PDF signature/MIME, page count, extracted characters, JD/title lengths, AI token limit, provider timeout, and concurrency limit.
- [x] Empty/scanned/encrypted/malformed/oversized inputs produce explicit safe outcomes.
- [x] Limits come from validated config with safe ceilings.
- **Verify:** adversarial integration matrix proves rejection occurs before OpenAI and returns expected codes.

### T015: Put the analysis endpoint behind temporary access and shared rate limits

**Dependencies:** T011, T014
**Likely files:** auth middleware, rate-limit adapter, `app/routes/api.analyze.ts`, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Anonymous public cost burn is impossible; use an approved invite/session boundary until full identity exists.
- [x] Rate/concurrency counters work across multiple processes and return retry metadata.
- [x] Origin/CSRF policy is enforced for browser submissions.
- **Verify:** unauthenticated, cross-origin, limit-exceeded, window-reset, and two-instance tests; no provider call on rejection.

### T016: Repair upload form state and validation UX

**Dependencies:** T012, T014
**Likely files:** `app/routes/upload.tsx`, `app/components/FileUploader.tsx`, shared upload schema, component tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] One canonical size limit is displayed and enforced.
- [x] Empty/rejected/remove/error states are visible; remove is `type="button"`, clears dropzone and parent state, and never submits.
- [x] Company/job fields are either persisted in the request or removed by product decision.
- [x] Submit is busy/disabled, duplicate-safe, cancellable where possible, and handles non-JSON failures.
- **Verify:** component tests plus keyboard browser tests for every state; errors use field association and `aria-live`.

### T017: Repair current route semantics and visual defects

**Dependencies:** T012
**Likely files:** `app/routes/resume.tsx`, `app/root.tsx`, `app/app.css`, route metadata tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Fix malformed background class, missing image alternatives, missing result `<h1>`, page titles, and branded error recovery.
- [x] Missing results no longer silently masquerade as valid content.
- [x] No focus outline is removed without a visible replacement.
- **Verify:** production-build browser screenshots at 390/768/1024/1366/1440; HTTP status assertions; zero console warnings/errors.

### T018: Harden the container and build context

**Dependencies:** T011, T013
**Likely files:** `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, deployment README section
**Scope:** S

- [x] Exclude `.env*`, `.git`, editor/cache/test artifacts as appropriate.
- [x] Pin approved runtime/base policy, use frozen installs, minimal runtime files, non-root user, health check, and direct process execution.
- [x] Runtime secrets are injected, never copied into a layer.
- **Verify:** image build, image history/context review, container scan, non-root assertion, health/readiness test, SIGTERM test, and synthetic production E2E.

### Checkpoint A1: Reliable MVP

- [x] T010-T018 pass.
- [x] Production-like synthetic upload → analysis → result works.
- [x] Failure matrix is visible and safe.
- [x] Security audit has no unmitigated reachable critical/high findings.
- [x] Human approves Gate A1 before persistence expansion (workspace owner, 2026-09-09).

## Phase 2: Automated verification foundation

### T020: Add linting, formatting, and unified quality scripts

**Scope:** M

- [x] `lint`, `format:check`, and `verify` scripts exist without rewriting unrelated files.
- [x] Production console debugging statements are prohibited or allowlisted.
- **Verify:** scripts pass cleanly and fail on an intentional temporary violation that is then removed.

### T021: Add unit test infrastructure and migrate self-check assertions

**Dependencies:** T020
**Likely files:** `package.json`, test config, `tests/unit/*`, existing self-check scripts
**Scope:** M; split by domain if over five files

- [x] Parser, rules, schemas, score bands, configuration, and errors run under a maintained test runner.
- [x] Tests are deterministic and make no live network calls.
- **Verify:** `npm run test`; mutation/manual fault demonstrates tests catch a scoring/parser regression.

### T022: Add integration test infrastructure

**Dependencies:** T021
**Likely files:** integration config, test environment helper, `tests/integration/*`
**Scope:** M

- [x] Production request handlers run against isolated test dependencies.
- [x] OpenAI/storage/auth are contract fakes unless a test is explicitly tagged live.
- **Verify:** endpoint status/error matrix and cleanup-isolation tests pass locally and in CI.

### T023: Add production-build browser E2E and accessibility tests

**Dependencies:** T022
**Likely files:** Playwright config, `e2e/upload.spec.ts`, `e2e/routes.spec.ts`, axe helper
**Scope:** M

- [x] Home, upload, progress/result stub, refresh, errors, keyboard, and viewport cases are automated.
- [x] Screenshots/traces are retained on failure.
- **Verify:** `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run test:a11y` against the production build.

### T024: Add CI quality gates

**Dependencies:** T020-T023
**Likely files:** CI workflow(s), `package.json`, CI documentation
**Scope:** M

- [x] Frozen install, provenance/signature check where supported, audit, secret scan, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, build, E2E, and artifacts run.
- [x] Required jobs are documented; no flaky retry hides a failure.
- **Verify:** green clean run and one controlled failing run for each required gate.

## Phase 3: Durable identity and history

### T030: Add database boundary and migration discipline

**Dependencies:** T001, T024
**Likely files:** DB config/client, migration config, first migration, integration helper
**Scope:** M

- [x] Transactions, typed repositories, migration ownership, and test isolation are defined.
- [x] Migration has forward behavior, compatibility notes, and rollback/recovery plan.
- **Verify:** migrate empty DB, migrate populated fixture DB, restart, and restore snapshot test.

### T031: Implement user session and personal organization slice

**Dependencies:** T030
**Likely files:** auth adapter, session helper, login/callback routes, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Secure cookie session maps an identity subject to one user and personal organization.
- [x] Logout/revocation/expiry work; no tokens enter client storage or logs.
- **Verify:** login, expiry, replay, logout, fixation, and cookie-attribute tests.

### T032: Implement membership and authorization policy

**Dependencies:** T031
**Likely files:** membership repository, policy helper, schemas, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] One canonical policy enforces owner/member/admin/viewer operations.
- [x] Cross-tenant identifiers never reveal existence.
- **Verify:** complete role-resource-action matrix at service and data-policy layers.

### T033: Implement private object-storage adapter

**Dependencies:** T032
**Likely files:** storage interface, provider adapter, key policy, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Server-generated tenant-scoped keys, checksum, private ACL, and bounded signed URLs.
- [x] Partial upload cleanup and reconciliation are defined.
- **Verify:** guessed/cross-tenant/expired URL denial and orphan cleanup tests.

### T034: Implement durable resume creation vertical slice

**Dependencies:** T030-T033
**Likely files:** resume repository/service, create route, upload UI integration, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Upload produces durable resume/version records tied to owner, organization, job metadata, and checksum.
- [x] Duplicate idempotency key returns the original result without duplicate objects.
- **Verify:** create, retry, transaction failure, storage failure, and ownership tests.

### T035: Implement durable home history

**Dependencies:** T034
**Likely files:** home loader, history query, home component, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Server-loaded pagination, stable ordering, empty/loading/error states, and tenant scoping.
- **Verify:** refresh, second session, pagination boundary, no-data, DB-failure, and cross-tenant tests.

### T036: Implement durable result route

**Dependencies:** T034
**Likely files:** result loader, result query/service, result component, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Direct URL and refresh return authorized stored state.
- [x] Missing/forbidden/processing/partial/failed/completed states have correct HTTP/UI behavior.
- **Verify:** production browser and HTTP matrix including guessed ID and expired session.

### T037: Add consent, audit-event, export, and deletion skeletons

**Dependencies:** T032-T034
**Likely files:** privacy schema/migration, audit service, privacy routes, tests
**Scope:** M; split if needed

- [x] AI transfer requires versioned consent.
- [x] Create/read/delete actions emit PII-safe audit events.
- [x] Export and deletion requests are durable jobs with visible status.
- **Verify:** consent denial, audit completeness, export manifest, deletion denial/ownership tests.

### Checkpoint A2: Durable candidate product

- [x] T030-T037 pass.
- [ ] Tenant isolation and durable refresh are independently reviewed.
- [x] Backup/restore and orphan reconciliation evidence exists.
- [x] Human approves Gate A2 (workspace owner, 2026-09-09).

## Phase 4: Asynchronous analysis

### T040: Add analysis records and state-transition policy

**Dependencies:** A2
**Likely files:** migration, analysis repository, state policy, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] State graph matches `ARCHITECTURE.md`; illegal transitions fail atomically.
- [x] Every transition records attempt, actor/process, timestamp, and request ID.
- **Verify:** exhaustive allowed/denied transition tests and concurrent update test.

### T041: Add leased PostgreSQL job worker

**Dependencies:** T040
**Likely files:** job repository, worker entry, lease runner, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Atomic claim, lease, heartbeat, backoff, attempt cap, dead-letter and graceful shutdown.
- **Verify:** two-worker single-claim, worker-kill reclaim, poison-job isolation, and shutdown tests.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** The worker loop, lease-loss abort, 120-second lease, bounded retries, final-attempt dead-letter transition, and graceful shutdown entry point pass unit tests. The local PostgreSQL matrix proves two-worker claim exclusivity, lease reclaim, and final-attempt dead-letter failure. The production provider itself remains intentionally fake in this test environment.

### T042: Add validation/quarantine and extraction stages

**Dependencies:** T033, T041
**Likely files:** ingestion service, extraction stage, storage/quarantine policy, fixtures/tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Unsafe/unsupported files never reach scoring or AI.
- [x] Extraction records pages, text checksum, warnings, duration, and bounded resource use.
- **Verify:** clean, multi-page, malformed, encrypted, empty, scanned, oversized, and timeout fixtures.

### T043: Add deterministic scoring worker stage

**Dependencies:** T042
**Likely files:** scoring stage, rule engine adapter, result schema, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Versioned deterministic result persists atomically with rule evidence.
- [x] Rerun with identical versions/input produces identical deterministic output.
- **Verify:** golden fixtures, schema validation, retry/idempotency, and forced persistence failure.

### T044: Add bounded qualitative AI adapter and stage

**Dependencies:** T041, T043
**Likely files:** AI interface, OpenAI adapter, qualitative stage, contract tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Typed structured output, untrusted-input separation, timeout, retry classification, token/cost capture, model/prompt version.
- [x] No provider call exceeds tenant entitlement or global kill switch.
- **Verify:** success, malformed output, refusal, timeout, 429, 5xx, budget exhaustion, and prompt-injection fixtures.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** Unit fixtures cover the declared provider outcomes. A hosted staging smoke test used only a synthetic resume/job/user, invoked the real OpenAI qualitative stage, and verified one persisted AI run, result, writer draft, and terminal `completed` analysis state before deleting all synthetic database and storage data.

### T045: Add partial results and provider-outage behavior

**Dependencies:** T043, T044
**Likely files:** orchestration service, result assembler, status mapper, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Deterministic results remain available when qualitative analysis fails.
- [x] Retry and user messaging distinguish transient from permanent failure.
- **Verify:** simulated provider outage, recovery, retry idempotency, and no duplicate usage charge.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** The new migration persists a deterministic partial result and safe empty writer draft after the final qualitative failure; provider requests use a stable idempotency key. Mocked outage, production-browser, and local PostgreSQL persistence checks pass. The hosted staging smoke test also verified that a completed qualitative stage is not rerun and does not create a duplicate AI usage record.

### T046: Add analysis status API and progress page

**Dependencies:** T040-T045
**Likely files:** status route, progress route/component, client poller, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Durable URL renders queued/stage/partial/completed/failed/cancelled states.
- [x] Polling uses backoff, visibility awareness, abort, and terminal stop.
- **Verify:** reload at each state, slow worker, network loss, session expiry, and accessibility announcements.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** The progress page has terminal polling stop, visibility-triggered restart, abort cleanup, accessible status/error announcements, and partial-result navigation. Production-build browser/a11y checks and local database status persistence checks pass.

### T047: Add safe cancellation

**Dependencies:** T041, T046
**Likely files:** cancel route, orchestration cancellation policy, worker checks, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Authorized queued work cancels; in-flight behavior is explicit and idempotent.
- [x] Cancellation never leaves inaccessible files or contradictory billing records.
- **Verify:** cancel-before-claim, cancel-during-stage, duplicate cancel, unauthorized cancel, and cleanup tests.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** The cancellation RPC is idempotent for already-cancelled work and explicitly returns `already_started` for in-flight work rather than falsely claiming cancellation. The local PostgreSQL matrix verifies queued-job deletion and both idempotent terminal paths; billing is not in scope until Phase 8.

## Phase 5: Scoring trust

### T050: Introduce versioned score semantics

**Dependencies:** T043
**Likely files:** schemas, rule engine, score-band helper, migrations/tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Passed/failed/not-evaluated/confidence are distinct; skipped rules leave the denominator.
- [x] All UI components share one score-band mapping.
- **Verify:** boundary scores 0/39/40/49/50/69/70/71/100 and no-JD fixtures.

### T051: Improve parsing and international coverage

**Dependencies:** T050
**Likely files:** parser modules, locale config, fixtures, tests
**Scope:** M per parser slice

- [x] Split contact, section, date, bullet, and layout parsing into separately tested modules.
- [x] Add international phones/locations, aliases, Unicode, multi-column/order warnings.
- **Verify:** labeled fixtures and per-field precision/recall report.

### T052: Improve JD phrase and skill matching

**Dependencies:** T050
**Likely files:** matcher, taxonomy data/interface, evidence model, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Multi-word phrases, aliases, boundaries, and evidence spans work without keyword stuffing false positives.
- [x] Taxonomy/version is stored with every analysis.
- **Verify:** positive/negative/adversarial labeled corpus and match-quality report.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** The versioned matcher covers 22 synthetic canonical-term labels with 13 true positives, zero false positives, and zero false negatives. It rejects URL/email-only and concatenated-word stuffing, and records bounded source spans. Local PostgreSQL migration and persistence tests confirm that the taxonomy version is required, stored with deterministic and assembled results, and carried through partial-result persistence.

### T053: Add scanned-PDF/OCR path

**Dependencies:** T001, T042
**Likely files:** OCR interface/adapter, extraction router, result warnings, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Scanned documents are detected before false scoring.
- [x] Approved OCR path respects region, retention, timeout, and cost controls; otherwise user receives explicit unsupported state.
- **Verify:** scanned/mixed/text PDFs, OCR outage, low-confidence, and privacy tests.

**Verification (2026-09-10):** Text-layer profiling routes text PDFs to deterministic extraction and scanned/mixed PDFs to `needs_ocr` before scoring. The default runtime is deliberately unsupported, makes no provider request, and gives an explicit upload-a-text-PDF message. Adapter tests cover approval, consent/privacy, region, retention, cost, timeout, outage, and low-confidence boundaries using synthetic bytes only.

### T054: Build benchmark and regression harness

**Dependencies:** T050-T053
**Likely files:** benchmark runner, manifest, reports, package scripts
**Scope:** M

- [x] Corpus manifest records provenance, anonymization, expected outputs, and permitted use.
- [x] Report includes field precision/recall, section F1, match quality, variance, latency, cost, failure rate.
- **Verify:** baseline report is reproducible and CI blocks approved regression thresholds.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** `npm run benchmark:phase5` reads only the manifest-listed synthetic corpora and reports field precision/recall, section F1, matching precision/recall, deterministic variance, latency, cost, and failure rate. Approved regression thresholds now enforce field precision/recall >= 0.95, section F1 >= 0.90, match precision/recall >= 0.95, failure rate <= 0%, and p95 deterministic latency <= 10 ms. The measured run passed every threshold: parser aggregate precision/recall 1.00/1.00, section F1 0.952, matching precision/recall 1.00/1.00, failure rate 0%, and p95 latency 0.667 ms.

### Checkpoint A3: Scoring trust [PASS, 2026-09-11]

- [x] T050-T054 pass.
- [x] Product copy and score meanings match measured evidence.
- [x] Human scoring/product review approves Gate A3.

**Gate A3 verification (2026-09-11):** PASS. The scoring/product owner approved the threshold policy and the current limitations under the explicit instruction to complete A3. Score bands are shared at 0-49 `Needs attention`, 50-69 `Good start`, and 70-100 `Strong`; product copy consistently describes ATS-like parse-simulation guidance rather than a proprietary ATS guarantee. The approved threshold artifact is `benchmarks/phase5-thresholds.json`, and CI enforces it through `npm run benchmark:phase5`.

## Phase 6: Accessible complete web experience

### T060: Build shared accessible application shell

**Dependencies:** A2, T023
**Likely files:** `app/root.tsx`, Navbar, global CSS, shell tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Skip link, landmarks, one-h1 rule, unique metadata, focus-visible, session/error states, reduced-motion tokens.
- **Verify:** keyboard, 200% zoom, axe, title/status, and viewport matrix.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** Shared shell landmarks, skip navigation, route metadata, recovery states, focus-visible styles, motion tokens, and one-H1 behavior are covered by the 390/768/1024/1366/1440 browser matrix. Reduced-motion and 200% zoom runtime checks pass; the expanded axe suite reports no serious or critical violations.

### T061: Complete upload and progress experience

**Dependencies:** T016, T046, T060
**Likely files:** upload route, FileUploader, progress component, E2E test
**Scope:** M

- [x] All validation/status/retry/cancel states are visible, announced, and refresh-safe.
- [x] Decorative scan GIF is replaced by optimized, optional motion.
- **Verify:** state matrix E2E with reduced motion and throttled/offline network.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** Upload validation, consent errors, cancellation, retry, offline recovery, and durable analysis polling are announced in the browser. The Phase 6 Playwright suite passes reduced-motion, offline, transient-status-retry, and viewport checks. Motion uses CSS/scene primitives with the reduced-motion media override; no scan GIF is referenced.

### T062: Complete result summary and details accessibility

**Dependencies:** T036, T050, T060
**Likely files:** Summary, Details, Accordion, score components, E2E test
**Scope:** M; split score and accordion work if needed

- [x] Scores/progress have names and values; accordion semantics/focus work; color is supplemental.
- [x] Mobile details collapse to readable layout.
- **Verify:** axe, keyboard, screen-reader spot check, snapshot and boundary-score tests.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** Score progressbars/groups expose names and numeric values, rule outcomes distinguish pass/attention/skipped in text, and native button accordion semantics pass keyboard component tests. The expanded axe and responsive browser suites pass; boundary score semantics remain covered by the existing Phase 5 unit suite.

### T063: Build multi-page Parse View

**Dependencies:** T051, T060
**Likely files:** ParseView, page-preview component, result mapper, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Page selector, extracted evidence, confidence, warnings, and limitation copy support every page.
- [x] Long links/text cannot overflow.
- **Verify:** 1/2/10-page, scanned, missing-field, mobile, zoom, and keyboard fixtures.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** Page-level text is retained through extraction, worker persistence, deterministic scoring, and the durable result mapper. Parse simulation tests cover 1/2/10-page evidence, low-confidence/empty pages, and per-page warnings; the component test covers keyboard page selection and limitations. The UI wraps long evidence and links, and the responsive/zoom browser checks pass. Scanned PDFs retain the existing explicit OCR-required limitation state.

### T064: Implement true keyword evidence view or rename feature

**Dependencies:** T052, T060, product decision
**Likely files:** Heatmap, overlay component, result schema mapping, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Human chooses true page-coordinate overlay or honest “keyword coverage” naming.
- [x] Match/missing/uncertain evidence is accessible without color.
- **Verify:** product acceptance, coordinate/evidence fixtures if overlay, responsive snapshots, axe.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** The product path is the honest “Keyword coverage” view, not a coordinate overlay. Taxonomy matches, missing terms, and lower-confidence generic matches are represented in stored evidence and exposed as text labels with source spans; component, axe, and responsive browser checks pass. No unverified coordinate-overlay claim is made.

### T065: Build account and privacy pages

**Dependencies:** T037, T060
**Likely files:** account route, privacy route/components, server actions, E2E tests
**Scope:** M per page slice

- [x] User can review consent, request export, request deletion, cancel queued requests, manage other sessions, and track request status.
- **Verify:** re-auth, cancellation windows, completed export, deletion, unauthorized and failure recovery E2E.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** `/account` provides identity/session review and signs out other sessions without storing tokens client-side. `/privacy` reads versioned consent records, creates export/deletion requests, shows durable status, and allows cancellation only while queued with owner scoping and audit events. Signed-out redirects and failure-safe UI are covered locally. Hosted owner/cross-tenant/RLS and service-only worker-RPC checks pass through `npm run test:hosted:rls`; hosted Phase 4 durable persistence and private-storage checks also pass. Authenticated re-authentication, completed export artifact delivery, and a live deletion-worker execution remain A4 evidence.

### T066: Add candidate evidence-grounded writing suggestions

**Dependencies:** T044, T060
**Likely files:** analysis schema, AI prompt, writer component, result route, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Summary and bullet suggestions are generated from resume evidence only and are clearly presented for candidate review.
- [x] Suggestions never invent achievements, metrics, employers, dates, skills, or credentials.
- **Verify:** structured-output, grounding, empty-source, keyboard, and accessibility tests.

**Verification (2026-09-11):** Structured output remains schema-validated, then passes a conservative server-side grounding gate that removes unsupported summaries/bullets and requires each original bullet to exist in source text. Valid, invented-fact, and empty-source unit fixtures pass; the UI labels suggestions as grounded and review-before-use. Live provider output and manual screen-reader review remain unrun locally.

## Phase 7: Production security and operations

### T070: Implement security headers and session hardening

**Dependencies:** T031, T060
**Likely files:** server headers/session config, root response, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] CSP, HSTS in HTTPS environments, frame, MIME, referrer, permissions and cookie policies are explicit.
- [x] Session cookies have an explicit bounded lifetime and state-changing routes enforce same-origin requests.
- **Verify:** `tests/unit/security.test.ts` and `e2e/phase7.spec.ts` pass. CSP defaults to report-only for burn-in; staging report review and enforcement approval remain A4 evidence.

**Implementation (2026-09-11):** Security headers are applied to SSR and the
production server, HTTPS-only HSTS is conditional, cookies have a configured
maximum age, and same-origin checks protect state-changing routes.

### T071: Complete threat model and abuse-case suite

**Dependencies:** T032, T042, T044, T070
**Likely files:** threat-model doc, security tests by boundary
**Scope:** M per boundary

- [x] STRIDE covers browser, auth, upload, storage, queue, worker, LLM, billing, admin, integrations.
- [x] Each high threat maps to owner, control, test, residual risk, review date.
- **Verify:** `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md` and the abuse-boundary tests are present. Security-owner review and treatment of deployment-owned risks remain required before A4.

### T072: Add observability foundations

**Dependencies:** T012, T040
**Likely files:** logger, metrics, tracing, web/worker bootstrap, tests
**Scope:** M

- [x] Correlated PII-safe logs, RED metrics, job-stage metrics, provider usage/cost, client errors/Core Web Vitals.
- **Verify:** `tests/unit/observability.test.ts` and Phase 7 browser telemetry tests pass; `docs/operations/ALERTS.json` is validated in local and CI checks. Dashboard/sink wiring and a hosted cross-layer trace join remain A4 evidence.

**Implementation (2026-09-11):** Structured logs, bounded Prometheus metrics,
provider cost signals, worker lifecycle metrics, and content-free browser
telemetry are implemented with redaction and low-cardinality route labels.

### T073: Add SLO alerts and runbooks

**Dependencies:** T072
**Likely files:** SLO doc, alert config, runbooks
**Scope:** M

- [x] Availability, latency, terminal-job, queue-age, cost, readiness and error-budget alerts have owners and actions.
- **Verify:** `docs/operations/OBSERVABILITY.md`, `docs/operations/ALERTS.json`, and `docs/operations/RUNBOOKS.md` define owners/actions, alert expressions, and runbook links; `npm run check:alerts` passes. Notification-sink delivery and provider-outage/stalled-queue tabletop exercises remain hosted A4 evidence.

### T074: Complete retention, export, and deletion execution

**Dependencies:** T037, T065, T072
**Likely files:** retention worker, deletion service, export service, tests
**Scope:** M per workflow

- [x] Policy covers DB, objects, caches, indexes, telemetry references, and backup expiry.
- [x] Workflows are idempotent, audited, retryable, and visible to users.
- **Verify:** privacy/retention unit coverage and the Phase 7 SQL/RPC implementation are present. The configured hosted project has all checked-in Phase 7 migrations applied; hosted SQL verification covers durable deletion-plan retry/reclaim semantics, retention claim behavior, privilege/RLS boundaries, and cleanup. Hosted storage and cross-tenant denial checks pass. Timed retention under production scheduling, live export artifact delivery, and a hosted restore drill remain A4 evidence.

### T075: Prove backup, restore, and disaster recovery

**Dependencies:** T030, T033, T074
**Likely files:** backup/restore scripts or IaC, DR runbook, evidence record
**Scope:** M

- [x] Database and object-store recovery procedures have an explicit RPO/RTO baseline and isolated-restore procedure.
- [x] The local restore verifier preserves ownership and integrity through manifest checksums.
- **Verify:** `npm run test:restore` is a deterministic local verifier. A dated hosted restore drill with checksums, representative user flow, measured duration, and remediation items remains required for A4.

### T076: Add load, soak, and recovery testing

**Dependencies:** T041-T046, T072
**Likely files:** performance config/scenarios, package scripts, report template
**Scope:** M

- [x] The deterministic load scenario exercises accepted uploads, queue growth, worker concurrency, provider throttling hooks, browser performance, cost, and worker recovery.
- **Verify:** `npm run test:load` emits p50/p95/p99, memory, error, queue-age, throughput, cost, and recovery evidence. Hosted DB-pool, provider-throttle, soak, and capacity approval remain A4 evidence.

### Phase 7 implementation checkpoint: local and hosted evidence — 2026-09-11

- [x] T070-T076 implementation slices, tests, operational docs, alert policy, migration, worker entry points, egress policy, container hardening check, and CI command wiring are present in this checkout.
- [x] Local evidence passes: 45 Vitest files / 190 tests, TypeScript, lint, build, deterministic load, deterministic restore, and 44 Playwright tests (including accessibility and Phase 7 coverage).
- [x] Database evidence passes: local Supabase reset through the full migration set, Phase 4 and Phase 7 SQL verification, and database lint. Hosted Phase 4 persistence, tenant/RLS, private-storage, and Phase 7 SQL verification also pass.
- [x] Dependency/security checks pass: registry signatures and attestations verify, the production dependency audit reports 0 vulnerabilities, and the secret scan passes.
- [ ] Gate A4 external evidence is complete. Hosted restore, notification delivery, monitored staging E2E, rollback rehearsal, policy approval, human security/operations approval, live provider verification, and deployment-owned malware/sandbox/egress controls are still pending and cannot be inferred from local tests.

### Checkpoint A4: B2C production readiness [IMPLEMENTATION READY; GATE OPEN]

- [x] T060-T076 implementation slices and local acceptance checks pass.
- [ ] Security/privacy review, restore drill, SLO dashboards, staging E2E, rollback rehearsal, and policy approval are attached.
- [ ] Human approves Gate A4.

## Phase 7A: Accuracy-v2, authoring, and verified artifacts [DIRECTION APPROVED; AA010 IMPLEMENTED]

### Approval record — 2026-10-03

The workspace owner approved the proposed Accuracy-v2 architecture and the recommended first implementation slice with “I approve.” This authorizes AA010 native-PDF evidence storage and the architectural direction in ADR-0006/0007. It does not resolve the unnamed first release domain/locale, approve scoring weights, select an OCR provider, authorize real-data collection, or close production Gate A4. AA000-AA005 retain unchecked acceptance items where concrete decisions or contracts are still missing. Implementation may proceed on the approved native-PDF foundation; dependent provider, calibration, corpus, and release work waits for those decisions.

These tasks supplement, rather than retroactively upgrade, the synthetic A3 evidence.

### Phase AA0: Truth contract and evaluation design

#### AA000: Approve capability map, non-goals, and claim ladder

**Dependencies:** A2; **Likely files:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`, Accuracy-v2 spec/subplan; **Scope:** S

- [ ] Product, scoring, privacy, and evaluation owners approve capability boundaries and the five claim levels.
- **Verify:** dated approval names allowed product language and explicitly prohibits employer-probability, universal-ATS, and automatic-hiring claims.

#### AA001: Approve score semantics and legacy treatment

**Dependencies:** AA000; **Likely files:** ADR-0006, Accuracy-v2 spec, migration/UX decision note; **Scope:** S

- [ ] Approve score names, dimensions, weights-as-hypotheses, unknown/not-evaluated behavior, evidence gates, and treatment of historical scores.
- **Verify:** worked examples prove no skipped rule receives free points and no LLM output is authoritative numeric input.

#### AA002: Freeze Accuracy-v2 contracts

**Dependencies:** AA001; **Likely files:** Accuracy-v2 spec, schema/API contract docs, ADR-0007; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Freeze versioned evidence, canonical resume, requirement, score, suggestion, and artifact state contracts.
- **Verify:** contract review covers IDs, provenance, confidence, versioning, authorization, retention, and failure/unknown states.

#### AA003: Approve corpus and annotation governance

**Dependencies:** AA000; **Likely files:** `CONSTRAINTS.md`, evaluation plan, annotation handbook, privacy data map; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Approve provenance, consent/de-identification, retention, two-annotator/adjudication process, partitions, segment taxonomy, and statistical reporting.
- **Verify:** privacy owner approves access/deletion controls; evaluation owner approves agreement and confidence-interval method before data collection.

#### AA004: Approve document/OCR provider bake-off

**Dependencies:** AA002, AA003; **Likely files:** provider evaluation protocol, security/privacy review, cost ceiling; **Scope:** S

- [ ] Approve representative fixtures, normalized output contract, accuracy/latency/cost/privacy measures, regions, failure policy, and exit boundary.
- **Verify:** protocol can compare native extraction and candidate providers without binding production to a vendor.

#### AA005: Approve first release segment

**Dependencies:** AA001-AA004; **Likely files:** release-scope decision, domain/locale matrix, template matrix; **Scope:** S

- [ ] Select one occupation/domain, locale/language, input mix, and initial PDF/DOCX formats; LaTeX stays later.
- **Verify:** unsupported domains/locales/formats have explicit UI behavior and no generalized claim.

#### Gate AA0: Accuracy-v2 architecture approval

- [ ] Human owners approve AA000-AA005 and change ADR-0006/0007 status only through recorded decisions.
- [ ] Initial weights remain hypotheses until calibration; documentation creation alone does not pass this gate.

### Phase AA1: Document evidence

#### AA010: Persist one native-PDF evidence graph

**Dependencies:** AA0; **Likely files:** evidence schema/migration, extraction service, fixture, tests; **Scope:** M

- [x] Persist pages, text spans, source method, confidence, and critical contact-field assertions for one native-text PDF.
- **Verify:** deterministic integration test reconstructs every assertion from page/span evidence and enforces owner isolation.

**Implementation (2026-10-03):** AA010 stores `native-evidence-v1` in the existing private extraction row, with Unicode code-point offsets and source references for name/email/phone candidates. All candidates are `review_required` with `uncalibrated` confidence; this is not calibrated extraction validity. Other critical fields await later structured-evidence slices. Privacy export includes the new column through its existing owner-filtered read, and deletion inherits the analysis cascade. `NATIVE_EVIDENCE_ENABLED` defaults to false until migration and full Supabase verification pass. Deploy migration `20261003100000_native_evidence_graph.sql` first, run `npm run test:aa010:db`, then opt the worker in. Disabling the flag restores the older RPC call.

**Evidence:** Real synthetic-PDF reconstruction, Unicode offsets, and absent-field tests pass. GitHub CI applies the full migration set to Supabase and passes the Phase 4, Phase 7, and AA010 SQL verifiers plus database lint. On 2026-10-03, the committed native-evidence migration was applied to hosted Resumide (`wreqkdavofpfblsupnls`; hosted migration version `20261003143648`). The same AA010 SQL verifier passes there: fabricated assertion rejection, atomic transition, ownership derivation, retry protection, and denied client-role privileges. The verifier now creates a randomly identified synthetic user/workspace and rolls back every fixture; a hosted follow-up query confirms zero remaining AA010 test users. This verifies AA010's scoped database contract, not the wider AA1 accuracy gate or production Gate A4.

**Regression verification:** 48 Vitest files / 197 tests, formatting, lint, typecheck, production build, registry signatures, secret/alert/container checks, synthetic load/restore, and Phase 5 benchmark pass. [GitHub CI run 37129633129](https://github.com/vsuman00/ai_resume_checker/actions/runs/37129633129) at `44c3427` passes all four jobs, including all 44 browser tests and the full Supabase database checks. After the hosted project resumed, local `npm run test:e2e` also passes all 44 tests, including `/readyz`; no threshold was relaxed. Local Docker remains unavailable and is not claimed as verified on this machine.

**Hosted advisors:** No new evidence-table security warning was reported. Auth leaked-password protection remains disabled and requires an Auth configuration decision ([remediation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection)). Three private service-only tables have informational RLS-without-policy notices (intentional deny-by-default), and unused-index notices remain informational; no indexes or access controls were weakened to suppress them. The worker feature flag remains opt-in; hosted schema verification does not imply production deployment or provider/calibration readiness.

#### AA011: Add geometry and reading-order evidence

**Dependencies:** AA010; **Likely files:** layout normalizer, Parse View, API read model, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Normalize page coordinates, word/line blocks, columns, tables, and reading-order warnings for supported native PDFs.
- **Verify:** single- and multi-column fixtures meet the reading-order gate and Parse View exposes page-linked evidence accessibly.

**Implemented native-text path (2026-10-04):** `extractPdfForAnalysis({ includeLayout: true, ... })` returns `native-layout-v1` pages with rendered viewport dimensions, normalized top-left approximate font-em text-run boxes, stable page/run IDs, Unicode code-point source offsets, and original PDF source order. Text is unchanged from the legacy extractor. Rotated/unsupported directions, invalid or out-of-page geometry, reversed vertical source order, and separated same-row runs produce explicit review warnings; column/table ambiguity is never silently reordered. The layout pass is sequential, keeps existing byte/page/character/time bounds, caps text items per page, and releases the PDF document. OCR replacement text never inherits native offsets.

**Storage/access/UI completed:** `NATIVE_LAYOUT_ENABLED` defaults false and opts the worker into the service-only layout RPC and AA010 evidence together. The additive migration validates text, ordered source coverage, page/run identities, dimensions, boxes, warning states, and role privileges before atomic persistence. Hosted Resumide migration version `20261003183757` passes the expanded SQL verifier (six malformed-layout cases, persistence/ownership, retries, denied client roles); every fixture rolls back. The server read model filters by both analysis and authenticated owner and validates the stored JSON before returning it. Parse View exposes page-linked text runs, textual line/word offsets, keyboard-selectable source highlights, meaningful warning/unavailable states, and bounded/paginated controls. The selected overlay is aligned to the rendered PDF image and clears on page change. Owner-filtered privacy export and deletion inherit existing protections.

**Remaining AA011 acceptance:** calibrated column/table structure inference and a locked-corpus reading-order accuracy gate are not implemented or demonstrated. Current multi-column/table-like layouts are explicitly `review_required`, not silently accepted or repaired. AA011 therefore remains unchecked rather than treating this completed native-text storage/access/UI path as proof of full geometry accuracy. No OCR provider, real-data collection, scoring policy, or production Gate A4 decision was changed.

**First-slice verification:** Real generated single-column, multi-column, and rotated PDFs preserve legacy text and reconstruct text-run offsets. Unit tests cover Unicode offsets, unavailable/out-of-page geometry, reading-direction and source-order warnings, item/page limits, and document cleanup on success/rejection. Full local `npm run verify:ci` passes (206 tests at that run, all 44 browser tests, Phase 5 benchmark, build/types/lint, supply-chain/security checks, load/restore); three subsequently added resource-bound tests also pass. No production feature flag, scoring policy, or Supabase schema was changed for this opt-in foundation.

**Storage/access/UI verification:** 220 unit/integration/component tests pass. The authenticated Playwright fixture passes against hosted Supabase with a real two-page single-/multi-column PDF and the new PostgREST RPC: keyboard selection, overlay coordinate alignment, page reset, explicit ambiguity warning, 320/768/1024/1440-pixel layouts, no serious/critical Parse View accessibility violations, and another owner receiving 404. Synthetic sessions are signed out, files/users are removed, and a hosted follow-up query confirms zero remaining test users. Security advisors report only the previously recorded private-table notices and disabled leaked-password protection; no new layout security warning appeared.

#### AA012: Implement selective OCR adapter slice

**Dependencies:** AA004, AA010; **Likely files:** document adapter interface, selected adapter, fixtures, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Detect scanned/mixed pages and invoke OCR only where policy requires it; normalize text, geometry, confidence, and provider metadata.
- **Verify:** one scanned and one mixed fixture pass adapter-contract, timeout, retry, cost-accounting, and safe-failure tests.

#### AA013: Reconcile native and OCR evidence

**Dependencies:** AA011, AA012; **Likely files:** reconciliation service, confidence policy, tests, UI state; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Preserve disagreements, calibrate confidence, and mark critical conflicts `review_required` rather than selecting silently.
- **Verify:** disagreement and low-confidence fixtures never reach a misleading authoritative score.

#### AA014: Add candidate evidence correction

**Dependencies:** AA013; **Likely files:** correction API/service, evidence UI, audit event, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Candidate can confirm or correct uncertain critical fields while original evidence remains immutable and auditable.
- **Verify:** authorization, concurrent correction, validation, audit, deletion/export, keyboard, and screen-reader tests pass.

#### AA015: Build extraction-v2 benchmark

**Dependencies:** AA010-AA014; **Likely files:** benchmark harness, locked manifest, report template, CI gate; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Report native/OCR character accuracy, field precision/recall, page coverage, reading order, failure, latency, and cost per segment and provider.
- **Verify:** locked evaluation is reproducible, confidence intervals are present, and any required-segment failure blocks AA1.

#### Gate AA1: Evidence-safe extraction

- [ ] `CONSTRAINTS.md` extraction floors pass on every approved segment; unsafe evidence reaches review/unsupported state, not numeric scoring.

### Phase AA2: Canonical resume and immutable versions

#### AA020: Add canonical resume persistence

**Dependencies:** AA1, ADR-0007 approval; **Likely files:** migration, repository, recovery notes, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Add tenant-scoped canonical resume, immutable version, fact provenance, and deletion/export semantics.
- **Verify:** migration forward/recovery, RLS/authorization, transaction, orphan, retention, and restore tests pass.

#### AA021: Map verified evidence into canonical content

**Dependencies:** AA020; **Likely files:** importer, canonical schema, fixtures, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Map contacts, sections, entries, roles, dates, bullets, skills, and source evidence without template coupling.
- **Verify:** native/OCR/import fixtures retain content, order, confidence, and provenance; unresolved values remain explicit.

#### AA022: Add version lineage and concurrency

**Dependencies:** AA021; **Likely files:** version service, change-event schema, API, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Edits create child versions with optimistic concurrency and append-only change events; rollback creates a new version.
- **Verify:** concurrent edit, retry/idempotency, lineage, compare, rollback, and audit tests pass.

#### AA023: Enforce fact verification

**Dependencies:** AA022; **Likely files:** fact ledger, validation policy, API, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Every factual value is sourced, candidate-confirmed, or explicitly unsupported; unsupported generated facts cannot be accepted.
- **Verify:** adversarial insert/strengthen/date/metric tests record zero unsupported accepted facts.

#### AA024: Add structured resume read and compare models

**Dependencies:** AA022, AA023; **Likely files:** query service, routes, response contract, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Authorized clients can load a structured version and compare two lineage-related versions with provenance states.
- **Verify:** 403/404 isolation, pagination/size, deletion, stale version, and deterministic diff tests pass.

#### Gate AA2: Canonical content integrity

- [ ] Import, correction, concurrency, lineage, deletion/export, authorization, audit, and unsupported-fact tests pass.

### Phase AA3: Job intelligence and domain packs

#### AA030: Persist evidence-linked job requirements

**Dependencies:** AA0; **Likely files:** requirement schema/migration, repository, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Persist typed requirements, importance state, exact JD spans, provenance, confidence, and version metadata.
- **Verify:** schema/repository tests cover duplicate spans, authorization, empty/contradictory requirements, export, and deletion.

#### AA031: Parse explicit deterministic requirements

**Dependencies:** AA030; **Likely files:** deterministic parser, normalizer, fixtures, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Parse explicit years, education, certification, location, work authorization, required/preferred cues, and negation without model inference.
- **Verify:** adversarial and international fixtures report per-type precision/recall and preserve exact evidence.

#### AA032: Add bounded model-proposed structure

**Dependencies:** AA031; **Likely files:** model adapter, structured schema, validator, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Model may propose typed requirements only when each item maps to JD evidence; inferred importance is distinct from explicit importance.
- **Verify:** malformed output, unsupported inference, prompt injection, run variance, timeout, and outage tests fail closed or fall back safely.

#### AA033: Add versioned O*NET/ESCO boundary

**Dependencies:** AA030; **Likely files:** taxonomy adapter, import job, attribution/version record, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Map occupations and skills to licensed, versioned O*NET/ESCO concepts while preserving original wording and mapping confidence.
- **Verify:** license/attribution, version pin, alias, ambiguity, update/rollback, and unmapped-concept tests pass.

#### AA034: Build first domain pack

**Dependencies:** AA005, AA031-AA033; **Likely files:** domain pack, aliases/rules, fixture manifest, docs; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Encode only reviewed domain concepts, credentials, terminology, and evaluation fixtures for the approved first domain.
- **Verify:** reviewer signs the pack; unsupported domains are labeled and cannot inherit the first domain's claim.

#### AA035: Specify optional market-frequency data

**Dependencies:** AA003; **Likely files:** dataset contract, provenance/licensing record, privacy review; **Scope:** S

- [ ] Define dated, permissioned market-corpus inputs and bias/coverage reporting without collecting or scraping data in this task.
- **Verify:** absence or expiry of an approved dataset disables frequency-based claims and scoring inputs.

#### AA036: Build job-intelligence benchmark

**Dependencies:** AA030-AA034; **Likely files:** benchmark harness, locked annotations, report, CI gate; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Measure requirement-type F1, importance F1, citation validity, mapping quality, abstention, variance, latency, and cost per segment.
- **Verify:** reproducible report meets `CONSTRAINTS.md` floors on the locked first-domain set before AA3 passes.

#### Gate AA3: Evidence-linked job intelligence

- [ ] Typed-requirement, importance, mapping, citation, and supported-domain gates pass; market frequency stays disabled without an approved dataset.

### Phase AA4: Deterministic scoring v2

#### AA040: Introduce versioned score policies

**Dependencies:** AA1-AA3, ADR-0006 approval; **Likely files:** score contracts, policy registry, legacy adapter, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Version dimensions, weights, bands, evidence states, normalization, and legacy read behavior independently of model prompts.
- **Verify:** golden tests reproduce each version and historical results never silently change meaning.

#### AA041: Implement Evidence Confidence gating

**Dependencies:** AA040; **Likely files:** confidence policy, analysis orchestration, result model/UI, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Compute evidence readiness from extraction coverage/confidence/disagreement and withhold dependent scores when unsafe.
- **Verify:** low-confidence and missing-critical-field cases show exact repair/review reasons and no authoritative numeric result.

#### AA042: Implement ATS Compatibility dimensions

**Dependencies:** AA041; **Likely files:** compatibility rules, evidence trace, score service, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Compute continuous, deterministic parseability/structure/contact/date/section/format dimensions with passed/failed/not-evaluated states.
- **Verify:** boundary, skipped-rule, layout, duplicate-content, and international-format tests produce complete evidence traces.

#### AA043: Implement typed Job Alignment

**Dependencies:** AA036, AA041; **Likely files:** alignment engine, requirement states, evidence trace, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Score explicit requirements as met/partially met/not met/unknown/not applicable, with caps and no double counting.
- **Verify:** repeated keywords, aliases, missing evidence, inferred importance, years, education, certification, and contradiction fixtures pass.

#### AA044: Remove LLM numeric authority

**Dependencies:** AA042, AA043; **Likely files:** qualitative stage, score assembly, historical-result presenter, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Model output is limited to cited qualitative suggestions; historical blended scores are labeled legacy and are not compared as v2 scores.
- **Verify:** changing provider/model prose cannot change authoritative numeric output for identical structured evidence.

#### AA045: Add score explanations and readiness experiment

**Dependencies:** AA044; **Likely files:** result read model, score UI, feature flag, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Expose the versioned resume state, blockers, top five high-impact improvements, reliable strengths, missing evidence, dimension contributions, evidence links, unknowns, limitations, and optional Application Readiness only behind an experiment flag.
- **Verify:** comprehension/accessibility review confirms users do not see scores as employer acceptance probability.

#### AA046: Build scoring validity and robustness suite

**Dependencies:** AA040-AA045; **Likely files:** scoring benchmark, metamorphic fixtures, report, CI gate; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Evaluate determinism, expert agreement, counterfactual invariance, stuffing/duplication resistance, prompt injection, segment error, latency, and cost.
- **Verify:** identical inputs are stable, protected-name changes do not alter score, and all required segment/claim gates are reported separately.

#### Gate AA4: Explainable deterministic scoring

- [ ] Score-contract, legacy, evidence, per-domain, expert-agreement, metamorphic, fairness/error, and comprehension gates pass.

### Phase AA5: Same-page authoring and grounded writing

#### AA050: Add structured result-page editing

**Dependencies:** AA2, AA4; **Likely files:** resume editor route/components, mutation API, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Edit the structured resume on the analysis result page by section/line while preserving source evidence and version identity.
- **Verify:** keyboard, screen-reader, validation, save failure, stale version, mobile, and no-JavaScript-safe recovery behaviors pass.

#### AA051: Navigate findings to editable lines

**Dependencies:** AA050; **Likely files:** finding queue, editor navigation, impact model, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Rank findings by evidence-backed impact and effort, display at most the top five in the high-impact section, and focus the exact affected line/section without hiding uncertainty or discarding the remaining findings.
- **Verify:** every released rule/requirement maps to an editable target or an explicit non-editable explanation.

#### AA052: Add typed suggestion patches

**Dependencies:** AA023, AA051; **Likely files:** suggestion schema, provider adapter, validator, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Suggestions identify source fact IDs, affected rule/requirement IDs, proposed operations, rationale, confidence, and clarification needs.
- **Verify:** unsupported IDs, free-form document replacement, cross-section mutation, malformed output, and stale-version application are rejected.

#### AA053: Add clarification questions

**Dependencies:** AA052; **Likely files:** clarification contract, editor UI, mutation service, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Ask for missing result, measurement, scope, method, or ownership instead of inventing stronger claims.
- **Verify:** candidate answers become candidate-confirmed facts with provenance; unanswered questions cannot silently populate content.

#### AA054: Add XYZ and alternative bullet patterns

**Dependencies:** AA052, AA053; **Likely files:** bullet strategy, prompt/schema, UI, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Offer Google-style “accomplished X, measured by Y, by doing Z” when evidence supports it, plus action-impact-context and action-scope-result alternatives.
- **Verify:** no template requires fabricated metrics; grammar, factual strength, duplication, seniority, and domain terminology are checked.

#### AA055: Add candidate-controlled change workflow

**Dependencies:** AA022, AA052; **Likely files:** change service, editor controls, audit/read model, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Accept, edit, reject, undo, compare, and restore-as-new-version are explicit actions recorded in the immutable ledger.
- **Verify:** concurrency, repeated action/idempotency, provider outage, audit, undo, ownership, and deletion/export tests pass.

#### AA056: Show projected and actual score delta

**Dependencies:** AA043, AA055; **Likely files:** preview scorer, result UI, score history, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Label pre-acceptance change as projected and recompute actual deterministic scores only after the new version exists.
- **Verify:** stale evidence, multiple edits, rollback, unknown requirements, and score-policy-version changes cannot display a false delta.

#### AA057: Benchmark writer grounding and model options

**Dependencies:** AA052-AA056; **Likely files:** writer benchmark, adversarial set, report, model policy; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Compare eligible models on unsupported-fact rate, citation validity, edit usefulness, domain quality, latency, and cost using one locked contract.
- **Verify:** zero unsupported accepted facts; a cheaper/faster model is selected only if it passes the same quality gates.

#### Gate AA5: Truthful candidate-controlled authoring

- [ ] Grounding, browser accessibility, concurrent edit, failure, undo, correction, model comparison, and candidate-review gates pass.

### Phase AA6: Verified PDF and DOCX rendering

#### AA060: Define renderer and artifact states

**Dependencies:** AA2, ADR-0007 approval; **Likely files:** renderer interface, template manifest, artifact contract, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Define deterministic input, escaping, renderer/template versions, queued/rendered/verification-failed/verified states, and evidence report.
- **Verify:** contract tests prevent template-specific data from becoming canonical content and block unverified recommended downloads.

#### AA061: Implement semantic preview and one PDF template

**Dependencies:** AA060; **Likely files:** preview, PDF renderer, template, tests; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Render the approved first-domain profile with semantic sections, selectable text, valid links, and no critical clipping.
- **Verify:** visual, text, link, page-size, font/encoding, overflow, keyboard, and screen-reader preview checks pass.

#### AA062: Implement one DOCX template

**Dependencies:** AA060; **Likely files:** DOCX renderer, template, tests, fixture; **Scope:** M

- [ ] Render the same canonical content and section order without divergent authoring logic.
